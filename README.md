# CS Learning Resources

A curated and continuously evolving collection of **high-quality learning resources**
for **Computer Science students**.

The goal of this repository is to provide a **structured, noise-free entry point**
to reliable materials for studying core CS topics, practicing problem-solving,
and building practical skills over time.

This repository does **not** host original educational content.  
It acts as a **curated index** of external resources selected for clarity,
educational value, and long-term relevance.

## How to Use This Repository

- Browse sections based on the topic you want to study.
- Each section is divided into logical subsections (e.g. exercises, theory, projects).
- Resources include short descriptions, tags, and difficulty levels.
- This repository is meant to be revisited as your knowledge grows.

The structure is designed to support **incremental learning**:
from foundational concepts to more advanced material.

## Organization Strategy

Resources are organized by **core Computer Science domains**.
Each domain may contain:
- Exercises and practice problems
- Learning material (books, courses, notes)
- Useful repositories and tools
- Project ideas

All entries follow a **standardized template** to ensure consistency,
readability, and easy comparison between resources.
