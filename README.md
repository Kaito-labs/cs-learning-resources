## Overview

**CS Learning Resources** is a curated, maintained index of high-quality, open-access materials for learning Computer Science.  
This repository gathers books, courses, lecture notes, exercises, tools, and exemplary repositories chosen for clarity, accuracy, and long-term usefulness.

Who this is for:
- CS students following an academic path
- Self-learners building a rigorous curriculum
- Developers re-focusing on fundamentals

How to use this repo:
- Browse by topic in the Table of Contents and follow a natural progression (foundations → systems → applied domains).  
- Each entry is minimal: **title — 1–2 line blurb — link** so you can quickly compare resources.  
- Mix theory (textbooks, lectures) with practice (exercises, projects, playgrounds) — revisit sections as your knowledge grows.

Organization & conventions:
- Resources are grouped by **core CS domains** (Foundational, Systems, Specialized, Practical).  
- Entries use a uniform format to remain scannable; maintainers aim to avoid duplication and low-quality links.

Quick note:
- This project **does not** host original lessons; it indexes external material only.  
- If you would like to contribute, feel free to open a pull request and make sure to follow the repository guidelines and Code of Conduct.
